    "bio": "I spend 40 hours a week staring at spreadsheets in a cubicle that smells like faint despair and Lemon Pledge. But from Friday 5pm strictly until Sunday night, I am a rock god. Well, bass player for 'Mediocre At Best', a cover band that plays the local dive bar once a quarter. We're terrible, but the beer is cheap and for those few hours, I'm not just Employee #429. I'm alive. Just don't ask me about my 401k."

    "name": "GardenGnome",
    "bio": "Retired high school English teacher, 68 years young. My grandkids set this account up because they said I needed a hobby besides yelling at the squirrels in my birdfeeder. Spoiler: the squirrels are winning to this day. I grow prize-winning tomatoes and read mystery novels. I miss my late husband every single day, but my garden gives me a reason to wake up. Looking for soup recipes and maybe a friend."

    "name": "CitySlicker",
    "bio": "Moved to NYC with a film degree and big dreams, now I'm 26, broke, and serving overpriced lattes to people who don't tip. I live in a shoebox apartment with two roommates and a leak in the ceiling. I'm working on a screenplay that will revolutionized indie cinema, if I can ever actually finish page 10. Fueled entirely by espresso, ambition, and a crushing sense of existential dread. Send money or bagels."

    "name": "GymRat99",
    "bio": "Tore my ACL last year and lost my identity as a marathon runner. Now I'm rebuilding my body and my mind, one rep at a time. The gym is my sanctuary, the only place the voices in my head go quiet. I post about gains and discipline because if I stop moving, the sadness catches up. Health is wealth, pain is weakness leaving the body, and other clichés that help me sleep at night."
